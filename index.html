					<h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
					<div class="half-width">
						<p>I've made my home base in Manhattan, New York with my small growing family consisting of a very sassy princess
							cat named Shai and a black dog named Manchee that loves every humans he ever encounters, with a special affinity 
							for blonde women and dark-haired people (I don't know why). 
							My journey into tech started when I felt burnt out as a small animal veterinarian and wanted to try something creative.
							As I started the journey of learning to program, I was fascinated with how much creativity goes into this fields. 
							I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="half-width">
						<p>That curiousity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, 
							I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. 
							Now I'm in the process of developing a career that combines my two loves- veterinary medicine and tech- where I can use my specialised knowledge and skills to create
							a platform that opens doors for endless possibilities.</p>
